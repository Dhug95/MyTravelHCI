# Overview
The main idea of **myTravel**  is to provide to travelers an intuitive and easy-to-use application to let  them  to keep track of all the payments done  during a trip, in order to always be up to date with their  budget. In particular, it can be used  alone or in group, and in this  latter  case myTravel  offers the possibility  to split some payments among the participants so that  anyone can get  rid of keeping bills with each  other.

*myTravel* will be useful for:
 -   **Alone Holiday Traveler**, which accounts all his/her spendings into the app in order to have an idea of his/her balance
    
 -   **Group Holiday Travelers**, which want to split some payments among the participants
    
 -   **Business Travelers**, which want to distinguish between personal spendings and business ones which have to be refund by the company

# Get started
The main page of the application is composed by 3 tabs, which can be navigated by means of the **lower Navigation Bar**:
